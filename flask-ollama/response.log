INFO:flask_app:Question = What is in this image
INFO:flask_app:Answer = The image shows the formula for Newton's method, also known as the tangent line method. It's an iterative method for finding successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function.  Specifically, it's given by:

  x_(n+1) = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)

Where:
*   x_(n+1) is the next approximation
*   x_n is the current approximation
*   f(x) is the function you're trying to find the root of
*   f'(x) is the derivative of the function f(x)
INFO:flask_app:Thoughts = The image shows a mathematical formula. I need to identify the formula and explain what it represents.
